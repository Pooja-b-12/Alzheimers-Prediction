# Alzheimers-Prediction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes the brain to shrink (atrophy) and brain cells to die. It is the common cause of dementia - a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that affects a person's ability to function independently. Onset of the disease is slow and early symptoms are often dismissed as normal signs of aging. A diagnosis is typically given based on history of illness, cognitive tests, medical imaging, and blood tests. It is estimated that there are approximately 44 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer's disease or a related form of dementia. By using ML and DL techniques, it is now possible to predict the stages of Alzheimerâ€™s: Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non-Demented, and Moderate Demented due to the advancement of technology in the medical sector. We do this by analyzing the MRI scanned images in order to classify the patients if in future there is a possibility of having AD or not. This is done with help of artificial intelligence technology. AD is predicted using ML algorithms by using a feature selection and extraction technique. Classification is done on the basis of oasis longitudinal dataset. The proposed classification model is helpful for clinicians in diagnosing AD. It is highly beneficial to bring down the annual mortality rates of Alzheimer's disease in early diagnosis with these ML algorithms.
